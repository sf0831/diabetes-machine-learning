# 🩺 Diabetes Predictor 📊

Welcome to the Diabetes Predictor project! This project aims to predict diabetes progression based on various physiological factors using linear regression models.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:
`git clone https://github.com/sf0831/diabetes-machine-learning.git`

2. **Install dependencies**:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **Run the project**:
- Execute the main script or open the provided Jupyter notebooks.
- Follow the instructions in the code comments to understand each step.

## 📋 Features

- Data preprocessing including handling missing values and splitting data.
- Implementation of linear regression models with and without bias.
- Evaluation of model performance using custom loss functions and built-in metrics.
- Comparison with polynomial regression models of different degrees.
